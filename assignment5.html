        <i>For this assignment you will continue using the D3.js library for data visualization. 1. Begin in Github by pulling new files from the cdw-public repo: Relational Structures 2. Relational Structures in D3.js: For beginners, you can read through the tutorial to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and syntax of relational structures in D3. https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Relational%20StructuresLinks to an external site. 3. View the examples files and source code Select an example and change the data in both the nodes CSV file and the edges CSV file. You could modify the data as synthetic data. Or you could source another dataset with a different context and alter the visualization to suit. If using another dataset, make sure that it follows exactly the same format as the original CSV file. The datasets should provide a meaningful and 'situated' context to the visualization - a topic of your interest. Always prioritize aesthetics, composition, color, typography, and line weights, etc. Add a single D3 canvas to your website. For advanced coders, include zoom and pan interactions, as well as node pop-ups and draggable nodes. 5. Add a link to your website with a single D3 canvas added. 6. Additionally, describe a way that a relational structure could be used in your project/interests. </i>
