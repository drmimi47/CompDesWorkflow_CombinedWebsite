        <i>For this assignment you will be using the D3.js library for data visualization. 1. Begin in Github by pulling new files from the cdw-public repo: Running A Local Server Temporal Structures 2. Then follow the Running a Local Server instructions in the readme file. https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Running%20a%20Local%20ServerLinks to an external site. 3. Temporal Structures in D3.js: For beginners, you can read through the tutorial to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and syntax of D3. https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Temporal%20StructuresLinks to an external site. 4. View the examples files and source code Select an example and change the data in the CSV file. You could modify the data as synthetic data. Or you could source another dataset with a different context and alter the visualization to suit. If using another dataset, make sure that it follows exactly the same format as the original CSV file. Always prioritize aesthetics, composition, color. Add a single D3 canvas to your website. For more advanced coders, explore the D3 library and develop another temporal visualization with data from a topic of your interest. 5. Add a link to your website with the D3 canvas added. 6. Additionally, describe a way that a temporal structure is used in your Precedent Study or how you might incorporate a temporal structure into your project. </i>

    <h3>"Occlusion" Inspired D3.js Panel</h3>

    <!-- D3 Visualization Container -->
    <div id="viz"></div>

    <!-- Additional Information -->
    <div style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background: #f0f0f0; border-radius: 5px;">
      <h4>About This Visualization</h4>
      <p>This D3.js visualization demonstrates <strong>temporal occlusion</strong> - how objects can be hidden over time by other objects in space. The circles represent data points from the CSV file, with larger circles potentially occluding (hiding) smaller ones that fall completely within their boundaries.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Temporal Structure Speculation:</strong> Occlusion represents a temporal concept because it shows how visibility changes based on layering order and "distance" to viewer. The larger circles are more opaque compared to the smaller ones, showing that the degree of opacity is tied to the radius. This could be speculated as earlier/older data, more important/less important, etc. Since for this visualization random numbers were used, real data from the project precedent could be swapped to represent the correlation between plant growth rate exhibited by the 400 families taking care of individual plant pots.</p>
