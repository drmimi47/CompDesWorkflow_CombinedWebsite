        <i>For this assignment you will be working in the P5.js framework and the Three.js framework. 1. Start by cloning the source files/tutorial/examples if you have not already done this: https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Clone%20RepoLinks to an external site. 2. 2D Spatial Canvases in P5.js: For beginners, it is advised that you read through the 2D spatial canvas tutorial and practice drawing with primitive shapes to get familiar with coding in a 2D drawing environment. https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Multiple%20Canvases/P5%20Multi%20CanvasesLinks to an external site. To get started, if you prefer, you can work in the P5.js code editor for the initial exploration: https://editor.p5js.org/Links to an external site. To upload your assignment to your website, you will need to follow the Managing Multiple Canvases tutorial, to add multiple sketches to your website. https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Multiple%20Canvases/P5%20Multi%20CanvasesLinks to an external site. (If you encounter problems with working in P5.js or adding multiple canvases to your website, you can start from the example files in this folder and modify into your own work.) 2D Spatial Canvas - Minimum requirements for beginners: - create a 2D static drawing using primitive shapes - create an interactive or animated 2D drawing - always prioritize aesthetics, composition, color - upload a minimum of 2 canvases to your website. For more advanced coders/designers: - explore the P5.js library more extensively - consider creating a drawing with more detailed and/or generative logic - always prioritize aesthetics, composition, color - upload a minimum of 2 canvases to your website. 3. 3D Spatial Canvases in three.js: For beginners, it is advised that you read through the 3D spatial canvas tutorial and practice adding primitive geometry, changing colors, adding an orbit camera, to get familiar with coding in a 3D web environment. https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Spatial-Canvases/3D%20Canvas%20ThreeJSLinks to an external site. Add the three.js canvases to your website above the 2D spatial canvases. Remember to load the three.js library in your html file (including the orbit controls library if necessary). If you need the code to manage adding the three.js canvases to your existing html file, this can be found in the 3D spatial canvas example files. https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Spatial-Canvases/3D%20Canvas%20ThreeJS/ExamplesLinks to an external site. (If you encounter any problems with working in three.js or adding multiple canvases to your website, you can start from the example files in this folder, and modify into your own work.) 3D Spatial Canvas - Minimum requirements for beginners: - create a composition with 3D geometry and an orbiting camera - create a 3D composition that explores materials, lighting, fog, etc - always prioritize aesthetics, composition, color - upload a minimum of 2 canvases to your website. For more advanced coders/designers: - explore the three.js library more extensively - consider incorporating procedural geometry, animations, shaders, etc - always prioritize aesthetics, composition, color - upload a minimum of 2 canvases to your website. </i>

      <h4>About These 2D Visualizations</h4>
      <p>The first canvas presents a static geometric composition with symmetrically arranged shapes in various colors against a black background, emphasizing balance and precise relationships. The second canvas transforms into an interactive experience where colorful elements orbit in circular patterns, accompanied by flowing lines that add movement and fluidity to the design.</p>

      <h4>About These 3D Visualizations</h4>
      <p>The first 3D canvas displays a clean geometric arrangement featuring basic shapes positioned within and around a circular wireframe against a black background. The second canvas explores advanced rendering techniques with realistic materials and dramatic lighting, showcasing how different surface properties and illumination can transform simple geometric forms into visually compelling objects.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
