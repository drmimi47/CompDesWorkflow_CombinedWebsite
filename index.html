      This course responds to the fast-changing world of software and programming by rethinking the tools
       we use to create and communicate work. It focuses on core 
       conceptual elements such as canvases, timelines, agents, and graphs that appear across platforms, 
       treating them as software-agnostic digital objects to study both technically and conceptually. Students 
       will explore web design as a public-facing research tool, using GitHub and open-source code sharing to build 
       collaborative workflows. The course emphasizes reading documentation, adapting existing code, and learning 
       from programming principles like inheritance and encapsulation. With tools such as Three.js and D3.js, students 
       will learn how to implement digital objects in interactive web environments for computational design.
