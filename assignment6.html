      <h4>About This Visualization</h4>
      <p>This interactive map displays the locations of drinking fountains throughout New York City's parks system. Each blue dot represents a public drinking fountain where visitors can access free, clean water. The visualization helps users locate the nearest water source while exploring NYC's green spaces, promoting both public health and environmental sustainability by reducing reliance on bottled water.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Application of Geo-Spatial Structure: </strong>Geospatial structures can be powerful tools for urban planning and public health initiatives. In the context of my interests in sustainable urban design, this type of mapping could be expanded to create comprehensive resource networks that help cities become more resilient and equitable. For example, mapping public amenities like drinking fountains, restrooms, wifi hotspots, and emergency services creates a foundation for understanding urban accessibility. This data can inform decisions about where to place new infrastructure, identify underserved areas, and help urban planners design more inclusive public spaces.</p>
