        <i>For this assignment you will use the Mapbox GL JS framework for mapping geodata. (You may also use D3.js, but I would recommend exploring what Mapbox is about). 1. Begin in Github by pulling new files from the cdw-public repo: * Geospatial Structures 2. Geospatial Structures in Mapbox: For beginners, you can read through the code snippets to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and syntax of geospatial structures in Mapbox. https://github.com/isohale/cdw-public/tree/main/Geospatial%20StructuresLinks to an external site. 3. Set up the example files so they are running with your own Mapbox access token. 4. Based on the example file "mapBox_Sketch_03.js" - create your own geospatial visual canvas. Find another GeoJSON file and load it. Define the style to make the data legible. The datasets should provide a meaningful and 'situated' context to the visualization - a topic of your interest. Always prioritize aesthetics, composition, color, typography, and line weights, etc. Add a single mapbox canvas to your website. 5. Add a link to your website with a single Mapbox canvas added. 6. Additionally, describe a way that a geospatial structure could be used in your project/interests. </i>
